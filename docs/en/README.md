## Adaptation plan
Windows: Windows 11/10 , Previous versions of Windows 10 will not be tested and adapted, and it is not guaranteed whether they can run.  
Linux & MacOS: The Tauri version is not adapted. The Electron version may be packaged, but it will not be tested (I have no equipment).

## Build
If you want to build it yourself.  
The Electron version does not provide the source code. For the Tauri version, please select the corresponding branch.   
```
git clone https://github.com/TopSea/Alive --branch tauri-v1
cd Alive
yarn

yarn tauri dev
```
Environment and dependencies can be referred to: [Tauri official documents](https://tauri.app/zh-cn/v1/guides/getting-started/prerequisites)    
Because I am the only one developing, the code is written rather chaotically, here and there randomly. The main point is that I myself can understand it :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye: .   

## About Alive
The previously open-sourced code will not be deleted. Just select the corresponding git branch.
